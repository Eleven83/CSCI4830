# CSCI4830 Final
 This is a repository for my Intro to VR Final Project.
For my project, I want to build an environment that resembles a scavenger hunt and allows the user to search for parts that make up a robot and possibly have the robot move when completed. This is an interesting concept because it gives the user a task or challenge and then the reward is to add a robot to the environment that will then be allowed to move randomly.
