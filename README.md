This repository contains various topics and examples of my work in Intro to VR at CU Boulder.

<b>Course Objectives</b>  
This course is designed to introduce students to the field of virtual reality (VR) and provide students with hands-on experience developing applications for modern virtual and augmented reality systems. In the course, students learn about the historical development of virtual reality technology and virtual reality as a research field, gain mastery of fundamental principles, algorithms, and design patterns in computer graphics, discover the perceptual science behind mixed reality technologies, and explore libraries and tools for creating VR experiences such as Unity. The course presents students with individual assignments and a semester long team project to develop a fully-functional application for the Google Cardboard, Gear VR, Oculus Rift, or HTC Vive. The course is primarily designed for ATLAS and computer science undergraduate students. However, graduate students interested in virtual and augmented reality technologies and undergraduates from other programs are also encouraged to take the class.  

Specific topics will include:
* The historical development of Virtual Reality
* Computer graphics and 3D modeling
* Human-Computer Interaction relating to Virtual Reality
* Modern Virtual Reality technologies
* Context and use of Virtual Reality


<b>Intro to Virtual Reality Final Project</b>  
For my project, I will build a virtual environment with Unity that resembles a city park. The user will be on a scavenger hunt and will need to search for robot parts that make up a complete robot. When all parts have been found, the robot will become animated and interactive. This is an interesting concept because it gives the user a task or challenge and then the reward is to add a robot to the environment that will then be allowed to move randomly.
