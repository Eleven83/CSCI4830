This repository contains various topics and examples of my work in Intro to VR at CU Boulder.

Final
Intro to Virtual Reality Final Project.
For my project, I will build a virtual environment with Unity that resembles a city park. The user will be on a scavenger hunt and will need to search for robot parts that make up a complete robot. When all parts have been found, the robot will become animated and interactive. This is an interesting concept because it gives the user a task or challenge and then the reward is to add a robot to the environment that will then be allowed to move randomly.
