* Context and use of Virtual Reality


<b>Intro to Virtual Reality Final Project</b>  
For my project, I will build a virtual environment with Unity that resembles a city park. The user will be on a scavenger hunt and will need to search for robot parts that make up a complete robot. When all parts have been found, the robot will become animated and interactive. This is an interesting concept because it gives the user a task or challenge and then the reward is to add a robot to the environment that will then be allowed to move randomly.
